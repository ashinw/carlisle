No Falling Away Aparihāni Sutta  (AN 4:37)

At Kīṭāgiri Kīṭāgiri Sutta  (MN 70)
“Monks, I do not say that the attainment of gnosis is all at once. Rather, the attainment of gnosis is after gradual training, gradual action, gradual practice. And how is there the attainment of gnosis after gradual training, gradual action, gradual practice? There is the case where, when conviction has arisen, one visits (a teacher). Having visited, one grows close. Having grown close, one lends ear. Having lent ear, one hears the Dhamma. Having heard the Dhamma, one remembers it. Remembering, one penetrates the meaning of the teachings. Penetrating the meaning, one comes to an agreement through pondering the teachings. There being an agreement through pondering the teachings, desire arises. When desire has arisen, one is willing. When one is willing, one contemplates. Having contemplated, one makes an exertion. Having made an exertion, one realizes with the body the ultimate truth and, having penetrated it with discernment, sees it.9
“Now, monks, there hasn’t been that conviction, there hasn’t been that visiting, there hasn’t been that growing close… that lending ear… that hearing of the Dhamma… that remembering… that penetration of the meaning of the teachings… that agreement through pondering the teachings… that desire… that willingness… that contemplation… that exertion. You have lost the way, monks. You have gone the wrong way, monks. How far have you strayed, foolish men, from this Dhamma & Discipline!

“Monks, there is a four-phrased statement that, when it is recited, an observant man will in no long time learn the meaning through discernment. I will recite it, and you learn it from me.”

“But, lord, who are we to be learners of the Dhamma?”

“Monks, even with a teacher devoted to material things, an heir of material things, who lives attached to material things, this sort of haggling (by his students) wouldn’t be proper: ‘If we get this, we’ll do it; if we don’t, we won’t.’ So how could it be with regard to the Tathāgata, who dwells entirely detached from material things?

“For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher’s message & lives to penetrate it, what accords with the Dhamma is this: ‘The Blessed One is the Teacher, I am a disciple. He is the one who knows, not I.’ For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher’s message & lives to penetrate it, the Teacher’s message is healing & nourishing. For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher’s message & lives to penetrate it, what accords with the Dhamma is this: ‘Gladly would I let the flesh & blood in my body dry up, leaving just the skin, tendons, & bones, but if I have not attained what can be reached through manly firmness, manly persistence, manly striving, there will be no relaxing my persistence.’ For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher’s message & lives to penetrate it, one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis here & now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”


The Traditions of the Noble Ones Ariya-vaṁsa Sutta  (AN 4:28)
“These four traditions of the noble ones—original, long-standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated, unadulterated from the beginning—are not open to suspicion, will never be open to suspicion, and are unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives & brahmans. Which four?
- “There is the case where a monk is content with any old robe cloth at all. He speaks in praise of being content with any old robe cloth at all.
- “And further, the monk is content with any old almsfood at all.
- “And further, the monk is content with any old lodging at all. 
- “And further, the monk finds pleasure & delight in developing (skillful qualities), finds pleasure & delight in abandoning (unskillful qualities).

A Giver of What Kindada Sutta (SN 1:42)
* A giver of food
  * is a giver of strength
* A giver of clothes
  * a giver of beauty
* A giver of a vehicle
  * a giver of ease
* A giver of a lamp
  * a giver of vision
* And the one who gives a residence
  * is the one’s who’s a giver of everything
* But the one who teaches the Dhamma
  * is a giver of the Deathless



The Buddha talks about three kinds of discernment. There’s the discernment
that comes from listening and the discernment that comes from thinking things
through. But then there’s the discernment that comes from practicing. You can
listen to the Dhamma, and you get right view on the level of listening. That points
As long as you’re in a position where you have to borrow somebody else’s
discernment, at least borrow the Buddha’s. But ultimately, you want to get to the
position where you can produce your own. You can depend on it. It really has
been tested and fine-honed by your practice. That’s when it’s really yours. And
paradoxically, once it’s really yours, that’s when you begin to let it go. But you can
still use it. After all, after the Buddha’s awakening, even though he said there was
nothing in him that was fastened to any views, he still taught right view. And he
still went out and argued with p
