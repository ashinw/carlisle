# Dorchester on Camellia Ct

Hi Stephanie/Rachael,

In this repository you will find my notes with regards to getting the Dorchester design on our property as per our requirements.

## Setbacks & build envelope

The build envelope represents the acceptable build region by the Monash council. This region is illustrated as the central area in the figure below.

### Summary

|**Setback**|**Total Surface Area**|**Percentage of property**|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Rear (ie. north)|72.17m<sup>2</sup>|10.51%|
|Right (ie. west)|50.54m<sup>2</sup>|7.36%|
|left (ie. east)|75.29m<sup>2</sup>|10.97%|
|Front (ie. south)|227.81m<sup>2</sup>|33.18%|
|**Total setback**|**425.81m<sup>2</sup>**|**62.03%**|
Table 1: setback summary table


|**Build envelope**|**Total Surface Area**|**Percentage of property**|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Largest rectangle|131.09m<sup>2</sup>|19.10%|
|odd shaped area|129.6m<sup>2</sup>|18.88%|
|**Total build envelope**|**260.69m<sup>2</sup>**|**37.97%**|
Table 2: build envelope summary table

|**Summary**|**Total Surface Area**|**Percentage of property**|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Setbacks|425.81m<sup>2</sup>|62.03%|
|Build envelope|260.69m<sup>2</sup>|37.97%|
|**TOTAL**|**686.5m<sup>2</sup>**|**100%**|
Table 3: Totals summary table

The data from the tables above suggest that should the planning minister's regulations be honoured then over 80% of the 686.5m<sup>2</sup> block is rendered unusable for a standard rectangular home design.

## Dorchester Ground Floor Sitting

To be more consistent in line with other houses in the court a slight preference has been given to reducing the front setback violation over the rear setback violation. 

This sitting of the Dorchester design on this property tries to achieve the most likely approvable positioning with regards to rear & front setbacks.

Figure 3: Dorchester sitting 

The regions marked in red are the violations (ie. the areas of concern that encrouch the setbacks). These violations should however be considered in context of the setback & build envelope section above.

|**Setback**|**Total Surface Area**|**Violation Area**|**Percentage**|**Min setback**
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Rear (ie. north)|72.17m<sup>2</sup>|**5.79m<sup>2</sup>**|8.02%|2.6m|
|Front (ie. south)|227.81m<sup>2</sup>|**7.94m<sup>2</sup>**|3.49%|5.86m|

In the context of things, these are the smallest violations that I could achieve which I feel will result in approval by council.

## Dorchester WRT utilities

Figure 4: Dorchester sitting wrt utilities 

The figure above illustrates the following points of interest:

1. The concreting require to the garage and the connection to the existing cross-over
2. The location of the new cross-over
3. The current location of the water meter
4. The proposed location of the underground pit
5. The exising electrical pole    


Note, Stephanie stated in an email:
> Please draw your own plan and mark everything thatâ€™s in the example attached. The underground pit is always located in the footpath, on the boundary line adjoining you and your neighbour, on the opposite side to your Garage and same side as Meter Box

Question:
In the "underground Example Pit location.png" sketch it outlines a 19.2m length I suspect from the end of the proposed cross-over to the proposed underground pit.

1. Is this the estimated distance what United Energy want?

## KDR considerations

The following is a list of considerations that I want to be considered during design & build

1. The fence on the south west is dilapidated and required immediate attention. 
    * If the garage is on the property boundary then the fence would be connected to the garage and should be built after the garage has been built.
    * If the garage is 20cm offset from the property boundary then it would be easier to built the fence after demolition but before building the garage.
2. I have a budget for implementing a solar system. I wish to maximise the roofing potential with preference to installing panels on the north, west & east sides.
    * Consider installing the Evap cooling unit on the roof such that it minismises shadowing on the solar panels.
3. There must be a demonstrated use of the existing cross-over that justifies its retention, otherwise council will insist that the original cross-over be filled in at the owner's expense.
4. I have contacted Tango Energy who is our retailer for both Elec & Gas. They informed me that to ask Carlisle whether my NMI (elec connection point id) & MIRN (gas connection point id) can or will be retained. They stated that an abolishment will require a new contract to be required when transitioning.
5. There is currently shade sails installed on the premise. We like the demolition to consider pulling out the pole and leaving them at the back of the property.
